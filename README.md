Methods that leverage GitHub's native functionality.

- [Footnotes (No central bib file)](https://github.com/bressler1995/Citation-Methods/tree/GitHub-Based/Footnotes)
- Anchors

### GitHub Pages Based

Methods that leverage web technologies available through GitHub's serverless hosting environment.
